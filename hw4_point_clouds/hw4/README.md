## Installation Instructions
Make sure you are using Python>=3.6.  We provide instructions that use conda as
a virtual environment.  You are free to use another virtual environment (such as
`virtualenv`) if you wish.

0. Install conda.  Follow this [guide](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).
1. Create conda environment using your terminal
```shell
conda create -n rss23 python=3.8 numpy scipy matplotlib
```
2. Activate enviroment (you will have to do this every time you open terminal)
```shell
conda activate rss23
```
